- use function builders to create deeply nested and constrained (receiver constrained) widget configs (--> like css)
- make configs reactive / observable values
- for MouseInteraction Widget: change an observable value during mouse interaction / provide different configs that are passed down for different states
- use Protocols to mark types as acceptable for fill properties --> Colors, Gradients, TransitionedValues, AnimatedValues
